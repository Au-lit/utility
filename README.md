# FAQ
#### Where is the documetation? I don't see it in the code...
See this repo wiki. (I dislike putting all the ducumentation in one single file).
#### Why not C?
Because it's not my language. And C++ is clearer.
#### Why is this not public domain?
Well it almost is; when you included a file form here there is already the copyright notice in it so for open-source projects you don't need to do anything special.
